# ShadowSc0peToRo0t

**ShadowSc0peToRo0t** is my personal learning repository documenting every step of the **Penetration Tester** Job Role Path on Hack The Box Academy.

Each module includes structured notes, technical breakdowns, and practical takeaways on my journey from fundamentals to full-root offensive security.

## Goals

- Document all HTB Academy modules from the Penetration Tester path.
