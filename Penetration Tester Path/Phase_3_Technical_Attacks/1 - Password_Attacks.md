> Passwords are still the primary method of authentication in corporate networks. If strong password policies are not enforced, users often choose weak, easy-to-remember passwords that can be cracked offline and leveraged to escalate access.

It's essential to understand how passwords are stored, how they can be retrieved, methods for cracking weak passwords, techniques for using hashes that cannot be cracked, and how to identify weak or default password usage.
